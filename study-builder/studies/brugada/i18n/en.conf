It is part of a larger initiative called Link My Heart, which studies other genetic arrhythmias. The purpose of this research is to help scientists understand how arrhythmias that predispose to sudden cardiac death, such as Brugada syndrome (SCD), are affected by genes and other factors. We hope this can help develop ways to better prevent SCD as well as diagnose and treat these genetic arrhythmias.",
      "p2": "We will collect, process, and store saliva samples in a research tissue bank located at the Broad Institute, a not-for-profit biomedical research institute. A research tissue bank is a place to store biological samples, such as saliva, that are linked to health information, and are used for scientific research.",
      "p3": "Your sample will be stored until researchers need them to do research. Your saliva sample contains genetic information called DNA. Genes are parts of the DNA code that contain instructions for how cells in our bodies work and grow. We will study your DNA through a technology called “sequencing”. Gene sequencing is a way of reading the DNA to find changes in genes that may impact the way your cells behave, which might contribute to different types of health conditions and disease.",
      "p4": "Tissue samples in this bank, which is located at the Broad Institute, will be used mainly for research on genetic mechanisms leading to Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) and to help improve health results among patients and family members at risk for SCD.
