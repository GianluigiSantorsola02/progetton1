  summary: get server-side workflow suggestions
  description: |
    This API takes a `from` state that indicates which stage of the workflow a
    user is coming from. The API then figures out where the user should go
    next using configurations on the server-side, and responds with a
    sugestion of the next state.

    If the `from` state is `START`, the API will return the "starting
    activity" of the study, if it is configured. If the `from` state is
    `ACTIVITY`, the API looks for either `activityCode` or `instanceGuid`, in
    that order, to figure out which activity the user is coming from.

    _This API allows access to temporary users._
